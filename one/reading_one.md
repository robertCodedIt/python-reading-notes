## Pain VS Suffering
>Pain:
It doesnt feel good, and going through this class will be very painful.

    However the price of pain is growth
    I understand that I will be pushed to my limits,
    and will want to give in everyday. But I also understand that
    it will all be worth it. and I will persist through it




>All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life

>This should not be confused with suffering.
suffering is pain with no purpose. Pain to no end
